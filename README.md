Conditional Geostatistical Simulation (CGS) R script for **Fish distributions reveal discrepancies between zonal attachment and quota allocations**.


Example of CGS implemented for the West of Scotland haddock stock, Division VIa, using Quarter 1 IBTS data from 2012. Percentages of the simulated adult biomass surfaces in EU and UK EEZs are calculated.

Script adapted from:
*Petitgas, P., Woillez, M., Rivoirard, J., Renard, D., and Bez, N. (2017). Handbook of geostatistics in R for fisheries and marine ecology. ICES Cooperative Research Report No. 338. 177 pp.*

Adult haddock fish density data was obtained from the *ICES DATRAS* database.

Spatial polygon boundaries for CGS were created using EEZ shapefiles from **www.marineregions.org** and raster bathymetry data from **www.bodc.ac.uk**.
